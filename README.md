# üëã Welcome!
First of all, I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to review my project. You can find the details below. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me using the information at the bottom.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è What is DrKey?
This is a simple alternative for autohotkey application that allows you to run apps when you press a key combination. Also you can run python scripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to use?
First, download and compile the source code or install the program from the releases. Then, configure the config.ini file according to your needs in the format: button1+button2 = app_location.
If you want to add scripts, use the script/autorun folder for automatic execution or the script/bind folder to assign scripts to specific keys.

That's it!
